## üéØ Hackathon Demo Script

### 1. **Opening** (30 seconds)
> "Small boba shops struggle with employee scheduling. Boba BI is an AI-powered business intelligence tool that optimizes staffing using multi-agent systems."

### 2. **Problem Statement** (30 seconds)
> "Business owners need to:
> - Balance customer demand with labor costs
> - Consider employee preferences
> - Adapt to weather and external factors
> - Avoid overtime and understaffing"

### 3. **Show the System** (2 minutes)

#### Terminal Demo:
```bash
python boba_bi.py
```

**Point out:**
- ‚úÖ "100 weeks of synthetic POS data generated"
- ‚úÖ "Data Analyst Agent analyzing traffic patterns"
- ‚úÖ "Weather Agent fetching forecasts with parallel API calls"
- ‚úÖ "Scheduler Agent creating optimal schedule"
- ‚úÖ "Final report exported to CSV"

#### Show Output Table:
```
WEEKLY STAFF SCHEDULE
===============================================================
Date         Day        Shift    Time         Orders/Hr  Staff
---------------------------------------------------------------
2025-10-27   Monday     Morning  08:00-16:00  15.2       2/2
2025-10-27   Monday     Evening  16:00-00:00  28.4       2/2
...
```

### 4. **Architecture Highlight** (1 minute)
Show the agent collaboration:

```
ORCHESTRATOR
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Analyst Agent (analyzes 100 weeks of POS data)
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Weather Agent (parallel API search for forecasts)
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scheduler Agent (constraint-based optimization)
```

### 5. **Tech Stack** (30 seconds)
- **AI:** Claude 4 Sonnet (multi-agent orchestration)
- **Function Calling:** Tool use for data analysis
- **Backend:** Python with Anthropic SDK
- **Extensible:** Flask API + HTML/CSS frontend ready

### 6. **Future Vision** (30 seconds)
> "Next steps:
> - Mobile app for employees
> - Real-time schedule adjustments
> - Multi-location support
> - Cost optimization algorithms
> - Shift swap marketplace"

### 7. **Live Demo (Optional)** (1 minute)
If running web UI:
1. Open `demo_frontend.html`
2. Type query: "What's the busiest shift next week?"
3. Click "Generate Schedule"
4. Show AI agents working in real-time
5. Download CSV

## üé® Presentation Tips

### Visual Flow
1. **Hook:** Show the problem (scheduling chaos)
2. **Solution:** Show the clean UI
3. **Tech:** Show the multi-agent terminal output
4. **Impact:** Show the final schedule

### Key Talking Points
- ‚ú® "Multi-agent AI system, not just a single LLM call"
- ‚ú® "Uses Claude's function calling for real API integration"
- ‚ú® "100 weeks of data ‚Üí identifies patterns humans miss"
- ‚ú® "Weather-aware scheduling ‚Üí predictive, not reactive"
- ‚ú® "Built for extensibility ‚Üí production-ready architecture"

### Common Judge Questions

**Q: "Why not just use a spreadsheet?"**
> "Spreadsheets can't analyze 100 weeks of data, fetch weather forecasts, and optimize constraints simultaneously. Our multi-agent system does this in seconds."

**Q: "How does weather integration work?"**
> "The Weather Agent uses parallel function calling to search multiple sources, then the Scheduler Agent adjusts staffing predictions by ¬±30% based on conditions."

**Q: "Can this scale to multiple locations?"**
> "Absolutely! The architecture is designed for it. Just add a Location Agent to the orchestrator and multiply the data by number of shops."

**Q: "What about employee preferences?"**
> "Built in! Each employee has availability (weekday/weekend/all) and shift preferences (morning/evening). The scheduler uses a preference scoring system."

**Q: "How accurate is the synthetic data?"**
> "It models real boba shop patterns: weekend peaks, evening rush, morning lulls. For production, plug in actual POS data‚Äîno code changes needed."

## üêõ Demo Day Troubleshooting

### Error: "anthropic module not found"
```bash
pip install anthropic
```

### Error: "API key invalid"
```bash
# Check your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

### Demo runs slowly
```bash
# Reduce synthetic data for faster demo
# In boba_bi.py, line 158:
pos_data = generate_synthetic_pos_data(weeks=10)  # Instead of 100
```

### Frontend won't connect
```bash
# Make sure API server is running on port 5000
python api_server.py

# Check browser console for CORS errors
# If using different port, update API_URL in demo_frontend.html
```
