## üîß Customization Guide

### Change Shop Location
```python
# In boba_bi.py, line 20
SHOP_LOCATION = "Your City, State"
```

### Adjust Constraints
```python
# In boba_bi.py, lines 21-26
MIN_STAFF_PER_SHIFT = 2
MAX_HOURS_PER_WEEK = 40
```

### Modify Traffic Patterns
```python
# In generate_synthetic_pos_data(), lines 55-66
traffic_patterns = {
    'weekday': {
        'morning': [5, 8, 12, 15, 20, 18, 14, 10],
        'evening': [25, 30, 35, 28, 20, 15, 10, 8]
    },
    # Adjust these numbers for your shop's patterns
}
```

### Add New Agent
```python
# In BobaBI class, add new method
def cost_optimizer_agent(self, schedule):
    """Agent that minimizes labor costs"""
    # Your logic here
    pass

# Call from orchestrator
def orchestrator(self, query):
    # ... existing agents ...
    cost_analysis = self.cost_optimizer_agent(schedule)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Module 'anthropic' not found"**
```bash
pip install anthropic
```

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
1. Get key: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Set in environment or boba_bi.py line 21

**Demo runs slowly**
- Reduce weeks to 10 in line 431: `generate_synthetic_pos_data(weeks=10)`

**Frontend won't load**
1. Check API server is running: `python api_server.py`
2. Check port 5000 is not blocked
3. Try different port in api_server.py line 263

**CSV won't open**
- File saved to current directory
- Look for: `boba_bi_schedule.csv`
- Try absolute path in generate_csv_report()
